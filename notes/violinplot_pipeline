1. open violin_data script
    1. script generates 16000 control samples and 11000 aud samples using add_samples function
    2. script places all generated control samples into "whole_control" dataframe
    3. script places all generated aud samples into "whole_uad" dataframe
    4. script uses "normalize_frame" function to normalize the data in each frame 
    5. script saves normalized frames of 11000 aud and 16000 control samples to pickle for divergence calculation

2. open kl_divergence script
    1. loads whole frame generated and pickled by violin_data script into "whole_suvr" and "whole_control" dataframes
    2. creates "divergence_frame" dataframe with columns specifying the types of kl divergence we want (like synthaud to originalaud divergence)
    3. need to average over every 100 sets of samples (1100 aud, 1600 control)
        1. selects 100 sets of 16 generated control samples and 11 generated aud samples
        2. places them in plot_frame_aud and plot_frame_control dataframes
        3. plots kde distribution for those 100 sets of samples (1100 aud samples and 1600 control samples total)
        4. directly calculate the relative entropy between kde distribtions for each type of sample to get kl divergence value
        5. add kl divergence value for that set to "divergence_frame" dataframe (essentially averaging the divergence for the chosen samples)
        6. divergence_frame is saved to pickle for violin plotting

3. open divergence_plot_violin script
    1. data is in wide format, need to change to long format for plotting
    2. kl divergence values are loaded from pickle file to "divergence_frame" dataframe
    3. in divergence_frame, "KL Type" column is populated with the divergence type for each divergence value in the frame
    4. in divergence_frame, "Region" column is populated with the brain region name each divergence value was calculated for 
    5. in divergence_frame, "Divergence" column is populated with the divergence values loaded in corresponding to each kl type and brain region
    6. all of this is collected into "plot_frame" for plotting
    7. region specific dataframes are created containing only divergence values for those brain regions
    8. divergence values are plotted with violin plot
    9. each region has 100 divergence values to plot (16000 control and 11000 aud generated, 1 "set" of samples contains 11 aud and 16 control, 100 sets are selected for each region to calculate divergence -> 100 kl values per region)
